# **Game Boy Advance - Play Doom**

This project is a **Game Boy Advance (GBA) Emulator-like interface** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It allows you to play the classic game **Doom** directly in your browser, powered by a **WebAssembly (WASM) port**.  

The interface mimics the design of a classic **GBA**, complete with a **power switch, screen, and buttons**.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Logo Animation:** A custom **logo appears** and fades out after a few seconds.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Game Load:** After the logo fades, the **Doom game loads** and is playable directly in the browser.
